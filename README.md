# ClothingScraper
The primary goal of this script is to create a tool with which buyers are better able to retrieve specific objects which they are looking for, and among them, find the best price. In the reselling community, the term ISO refers to 'In Search Of', typically used when a buyer is looking for something specific e.g. "ISO LoveShackFancy Kassius Cardigan". This usually invites members of the reselling community to share the object in the hopes it'll eventually reach a seller; however, we are hoping to automate this approach by building a tool that will a) scrape these websites using a given name, description, or image that the user gives, with attributes like material, size, color, and brand being taken into consideration. Then b) if the name of some desired item is unknown and unavailable by seller and/or buyer, this tool will aim to scrape these websites and retrieve the unnamed, non-descript images and return those posts as well, this second part will utilize computer vision models which will be trained to identify objects of the same design in various backgrounds, poses, etc. This tool will target clothing reselling sites specifically.
